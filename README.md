# Vector Space Model in Python

This is implementation of Vector Space Model Python. 

*Objective of this project is to implement the Vector Space Model (VSM). Dataset contains a collection of about 22,000 text files.*

*Task is to implement a VSM and given a query, program should return top 5 documents related to the query.*

I have done this project on Google Colaboratory. So you can just click this shareable link (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Oio0HMNVipLcO_vTrNiaQxB45ef0TgqJ) and run. 

OR you can download the notebook and run on local machine or whatever you want.

I will upadate the notebook with more optimized code. This time it takes a lot of time and memory.
