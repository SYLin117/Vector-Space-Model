# Vector-Space-Model
** Vector Space Model**  I have done this project on Google Colaboratory. So you can just click this shareable link (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Oio0HMNVipLcO_vTrNiaQxB45ef0TgqJ) and run.  OR you can download the notebook and run on local machine or whatever you want.  I will upadate the notebook with more optimized code. This time it takes a lot of time and memory.
